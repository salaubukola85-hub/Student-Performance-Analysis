## 📊 Dataset Description

The analysis combines **five datasets**:

1. **Students Data** — Enrollment details, course selection, campus information.
2. **Finance Data** — Revenue and financial performance across campuses.
3. **Instructor Data** — Instructor assignments and student distribution.
4. **Performance Data** — Student scores, study modes, and academic outcomes.
5. **Target Data** — Institutional enrollment targets for performance comparison.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Power BI** — Data modeling, visualization, dashboard development
* **Power Query** — Data cleaning and transformation
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** — Calculated measures and KPIs
* **Data Modeling** — Relationship creation between multiple tables

---

## 🔗 Data Modeling Approach

A relational data model was created in Power BI by connecting the five datasets using common fields such as:

* Student ID
* Course
* Campus
* Instructor ID

This enabled cross-table analysis and accurate aggregation of performance metrics.

---

## 📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The following KPIs were developed using DAX:

* Total Students
* Enrollment Target vs Actual
* Dropout Rate
* Average Student Score
* Total Revenue
* Revenue by Campus
* Course Enrollment Distribution

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

* Student enrollment (150) is significantly below the institutional target (2000), indicating major growth opportunities.
* Technical courses such as AI and Data Science show higher enrollment compared to other programs.
* Some courses experience higher dropout rates, suggesting the need for improved student support and curriculum adjustments.
* Physical learning mode students perform better academically than online students.
* Revenue distribution varies across campuses, with certain locations outperforming others.

---
