#  Tech Studio Performance Analysis Dashboard

##  Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end data analysis of Tech Studio’s institutional performance using **Power BI**. The goal of the analysis is to evaluate student enrollment, academic performance, revenue generation, instructor distribution, and dropout trends across multiple campuses and courses to support data-driven decision-making.

The dashboard integrates multiple datasets to provide a comprehensive view of operational efficiency and business growth opportunities within the organization.

## Business Problem

Tech Studio aims to increase student enrollment, improve retention, and achieve its revenue targets. However, there is a noticeable gap between actual performance and institutional goals, including:

* Low enrollment compared to the target
* Course-specific dropout challenges
* Differences in performance across campuses and study modes
* Need for better strategic planning based on data insights

This project addresses these challenges by identifying patterns, trends, and actionable insights.

## Dataset Description

The analysis combines **five datasets**:

1. **Students Data** — Enrollment details, course selection, campus information.
2. **Finance Data** — Revenue and financial performance across campuses.
3. **Instructor Data** — Instructor assignments and student distribution.
4. **Performance Data** — Student scores, study modes, and academic outcomes.
5. **Target Data** — Institutional enrollment targets for performance comparison.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

* **Power BI** — Data modeling, visualization, dashboard development
* **Power Query** — Data cleaning and transformation
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** — Calculated measures and KPIs
* **Data Modeling** — Relationship creation between multiple tables

---

## Data Modeling Approach

A relational data model was created in Power BI by connecting the five datasets using common fields such as:

* Student ID
* Course
* Campus
* Instructor ID

This enabled cross-table analysis and accurate aggregation of performance metrics.

---

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The following KPIs were developed using DAX:

* Total Students
* Enrollment Target vs Actual
* Dropout Rate
* Average Student Score
* Total Revenue
* Revenue by Campus
* Course Enrollment Distribution

---

## Key Insights

* Student enrollment (150) is significantly below the institutional target (2000), indicating major growth opportunities.
* Technical courses such as AI and Data Science show higher enrollment compared to other programs.
* Some courses experience higher dropout rates, suggesting the need for improved student support and curriculum adjustments.
* Physical learning mode students perform better academically than online students.
* Revenue distribution varies across campuses, with certain locations outperforming others.

---

## Business Recommendations

* Increase marketing efforts and partnerships to improve enrollment numbers.
* Implement mentorship and academic support programs to reduce dropout rates.
* Strengthen online learning engagement to improve student performance.
* Replicate successful strategies from high-performing campuses across other locations.
* Introduce flexible payment options and promotional offers to attract more students.
